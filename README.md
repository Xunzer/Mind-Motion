## About [Mind & Motion](https://mind-motion-b78f91a6b700.herokuapp.com/intro)

Mind & Motion is a platform designed to support stroke rehabilitation by combining the power of machine learning and data-driven insights. The project uses a machine learning model from MediaPipe to grade exercises tailored for stroke recovery, providing real-time feedback to users. The goal of Mind & Motion is to make recovery efficient, accessible, and empowering, helping individuals regain independence and enhance their quality of life.

The platform offers a supportive digital environment where patients can perform rehabilitation exercises with guidance and track their progress. Developed with React.js, Django, and JavaScript, Mind & Motion ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience for patients on their recovery journey.
